Git collaboration guide
=======================

There are many projects that are developed using git. However, many people
do not contribute to these projects because of git and its reputation as a
difficult tool. To be honest, git is a difficult tool, but if one focuses
only on its main features, they can learn git and be productive with it
in few minutes.

This guide will show you how to use git to contribute to a fictitious
`fluffytron` project. We will set up our own copy of the `fluffytron`
repository then make some changes and see these modifications being
integrated back into the `fluffytron` project.
